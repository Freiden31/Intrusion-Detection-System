# Real-Time Network Traffic Classification for Anomaly Detection

A cyber security project for final year aim to develop a  real-time network traffic classification to detect anomalous behavior of packet in a server network. This detect threshold such:
 - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS),
 - Denial of Service (DoS),
 - Infiltration,
 - Port Scan,
 - Brute force, and
 - Bot Net.

Note: '''The system classify if safe or anomaly.'''

By training machine learning algorithms to select the best performing, Random Forest outperformed Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes with 97 percent ( of 70% train set ), 88 percent ( of 30% test set ), and 89 percent ( of 5-folds Cross- Validation ) for unseen data injected with 10 percent noise - from CIC-IDS 2017 dataset.

The system develop through the specification of Reactjs ( JavaScript library ) for frontend, Django ( Python backend framework ), Tailwindcss, and MaterialUI ( CSS framework ).

The system features are:
- Authentication ( Email Backend )
  * Registration
  * Login
  * Reset Password
- Server Credential Input ( requires some configuration in the server allowing tester to monitor server network - mush handle with permissions )
- Dashboard
  * Packets Information Table
  * Rythm Graph
- Notification
- Report
